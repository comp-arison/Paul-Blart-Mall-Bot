Created by Nathan Boehm
Special thanks to freeCodeCamp.org for making this video, which helped me get this thing up and running:

Also thanks to Tajomstvo, who made the html for the website.
Also also thanks to the Tracle.tv Discord server, for being generally cool.
And finally, thanks to Kevin James for blessing this Earth.
TODO:
Fix the bot slowdown (builds over time every time stocktick is called)
Do something with the quiz statistics on the website
Start looking for website domains
Get this on a bot list website
