Special thanks to freeCodeCamp.org for making this video, which helped me get this thing up and running:

Also thanks to Tajomstvo, who made the html for the website.

Also also thanks to the Tracle.tv Discord server, for being generally cool.

And finally, thanks to Kevin James for blessing this Earth.

Feel free to take this and make whatever you want out of it. Credit would be appreciated, But not necessary.

The only thing not included in this is a file called .env which just contains the text TOKEN=(my bot's token that you can't know!!!!)
